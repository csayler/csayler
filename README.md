A little info about my work and what I love doing. I’m currently working on automating secure software development lifecycle. Devops, Unix/Linux, k8s, cloud and Security are my thing. The environments that I work with are usually fall into Hybrid Cloud involving AWS, Kubernetes, GCP, Azure and Openstack. I am very opensource centric.
- CICD Tools I use Jenkins, GiHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible, GOlang(beginner), Helm Charts, ChartMuseum and Docker.
- Security Tools I have used Twistlock, Rapid7, BlackDuck, SNYK, Jfrog artifact, NIST, CIS and QWASP. 
- I have worked for @HPE, @NASA, @Viasat and @NAVAIR. Currently @Bain.
